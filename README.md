# Student_Record_Management_System

This is a simple console-based Java application that implements a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) system for managing student records.
The project follows object-oriented principles, using a dedicated Student class to store and operate on student data, and a separate App class to handle user interaction.
All data is handled using an ArrayList, allowing dynamic addition, modification, and removal of student records during program execution.

# Features:

Add a new student (Roll No, Name, Course)
View all student records
Update an existing student's information
Delete a student by roll number
Simple user-friendly menu-driven interface
